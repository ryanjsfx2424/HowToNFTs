Structure of this repo:

-> contracts: holds the solidity files, associated information needed
   for verification on etherscan (etc)

   Note that I dev/test/deploy on Remix. Hopefully soon I'll transition
   to using Truffle/Hardhat/Brownie for more traceable testing/local dev.

-> nftgifs: contains the original gifs Michael sent me.

-> nftmp4s: just converted the gifs to mp4s and generates the 'stacked'
   versions using ffmpeg (see tests/converter.py)

-> metadata: hosts json files corresponding to each nft - this gets updated
   as a result of 'stacking'

-> helpers: has some nice scripts there. Developed at the home level so paths
   are currently probably broken.

-> GoogleCloud: backend.py THE MOST IMPORTANT THING.
